The Java Collection Framework offers several benefits:

Consistent API: The framework provides a standard set of interfaces like Collection, Set, List, and Map. Classes such as ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector that implement these interfaces have similar methods, making the API easy to use.

Less programming effort: Developers don't need to design collections from scratch. They can focus on using collections effectively in their programs, thanks to the abstraction principle in object-oriented programming.

Better performance and quality: The framework includes optimized implementations of common data structures and algorithms. This allows developers to use these high-performance implementations, improving the speed and quality of their programs without extra effort.

This repository will be helping you to understand Java Collection framework in depth with methods they use in hidden layer.
